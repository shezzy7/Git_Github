            clone
clone basically refers to copy of something.For example if we save a picture from instagram then it will be saved to our gallery it means that that we have cloned that picture.So in git clone means cloning a repository on our local machine.Mean if we have a repository on github and we want to save/access it on our loacl machine we get this by using clone command.
for cloning we use command -> git clone <-some link->
Here we paste link of our github repository.For getting link we go to our repository and press the 'code' button ,copy https link and paste this link here.
After cloning if we made any change to any file if prevoulsy was present in our repository then after saving these changes this file name's color will change and a letter M will apear with this file's name which means this file is modified and we have to commit it to save these changes on our github.
